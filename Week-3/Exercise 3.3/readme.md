//  ----   EXPLANATION - OUTPUT OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE 'COUNT IS 0' 
    
    //  ----   REASON - WHEN WHEN WE CALL INCREMENT() ON LINE 18,19,20. PROGRAM WILL CHECK FUNCTION INRCEMENT() ON LINE 5 
    //         WHEN THE COUNT IS 0 AND BY CALLING INCREMENT() THREE TIMES IT IS INCREMENTING COUNT VALUE TO 1 , 2 , 3 ONLY IN THAT FUNCTION 
    //         WHICH MEANS IN THAT SCOPE(only).
    
    //  ------ SIMILARLY WHEN ON LINE 21 WE CALL LOG(). PROGARM CHECKS FOR LOG() FUNCTIONS WHICH ON LINE LINE 11
    //         AT THE IT WILL PERFORM CLOSURE WHICH TAKING VALUE FROM IT'S LEXICAL SCOPE WHEN CONSOLE.LOG(MESSAGE) ON LINE 13
    //         IS EVOKED. WHICH WILL STORE VALUE COUNT = 0. AND WILL PERFORM LOG() FUNCTION AND WE WILL GET VALUE OF
    //         COUNT AS 0.
